You are working in this repository: **Dima OS Dashboard**.

## Read this first
- Always read `AI_CONTEXT.md` before making changes.

## What to do
- Implement/adjust the dashboard per `AI_CONTEXT.md`.
- Keep changes minimal and mobile‑first.
- Keep the project fully static.

## How to communicate progress
- After each meaningful milestone, update `AI_CONTEXT.md` “Current status” and “Next steps” so another tool (Gemini CLI / another agent) can continue without re‑deriving context.
